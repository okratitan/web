**FyFoto**

My first project to get my feet wet with Fyne has been FyFoto.  It will basically have all the functionality and behavior that EPhoto (see below) has - except it will be written in Go and Fyne which I find
more attractive than the EFL these days.

You can find Fyfoto at my Github here: [FyFoto Git](https://github.com/okratitan/fyfoto.git)
FyFoto has not been released or made publicly available yet, but I plan to have it on Github very soon!  Until then you can get a sneak peak of the progress:
