# Ephoto

***Ephoto 1.5 Has Been Released!!!***

 Read The [Release Post](../blog/ephoto-1_5-released/) For More Information!

Ephoto is an image viewer and editor written using the [Enlightenment Foundation Libraries](http://www.enlightenment.org).  It focuses on simplicity and ease of use, while taking advantage of the speed and small footprint the EFL provide.  You can view Ephoto's project page on the Enlightenment wiki located at: <https://phab.enlightenment.org/w/projects/ephoto>.  Ephoto's source can be found in the Enlightenment git repository: <http://git.enlightenment.org/apps/ephoto.git]> or on Github at <http://github.com/okratitan/ephoto.git>

Ephoto's features include:

* Browsing the filesystem and displaying images in an easy to use grid view.
* Browsing images in a single image view format.
* Viewing images in a slideshow.
* Editing your image with features such as cropping, auto enhance, blurring, sharpening, brightness/contrast/gamma adjustments, hue/saturation/value adjustments, and color level adjustment.
* Applying artistic filters to your image such as black and white and old photo.
* Drag And Drop along with file operations to easy maintain your photo directories.

Here are a few example screenshots of Ephoto in action:

# FyFoto

My first project to get my feet wet with Fyne has been FyFoto.  It will basically have all the functionality and behavior that EPhoto (see below) has - except it will be written in Go and Fyne which I find
more attractive than the EFL these days.

You can find Fyfoto at my Github here: [FyFoto Git](https://github.com/okratitan/fyfoto.git)
FyFoto has not been released or made publicly available yet, but I plan to have it on Github very soon!  Until then you can get a sneak peak of the progress:

# Fyne and Fyne Desktop

Lately my main focus has been working with a great team, some of which are old friends, on a new golang cross-platform toolkit called Fyne.  You can read more about it here: [Fyne](http://www.fyne.io)

I have been spending a significant amount of work lately on the Fyne Desktop which you can read about here: [Fynedesk Features and Improvements](/blog/fynedesk/)
