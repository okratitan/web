title: "Mechanical Keyboards"

One of my favorite hobbies is building and using Mechanical Keyboards and all of the accessories that come with it! Keyboards can include cases, plates, pcbs, switches, stabilizers, and keycaps.
Keycaps are usually run in group buys and you can get so many different designs as well as desk mats to match.  These are my current keyboards that I've built along with details (I need to take better pics soon!):

*Dixie Mech - Bauer - 65%*
