I haven't posted here in a long time.  By the end of 2019 I was forced to take time away from most of my tech work
and hobbies in order to deal with health issues in my family.  As 2020 rolled around, it became one gut punch after
another, and I couldn't find the time or motivation to write or even take part in most of my hobbies or side projects.

Towards the end of 2020, things started taking a turn for the better - happier if you will.  I took a new job with 
Ardan Labs doing Go microservice development, and I have love every single minute of it.  I had spent the better part
of a year searching for a new job, preferably remote, where I could be challenged and take part in the bleeding edge 
of technology and innovation and finally getting that offer and starting the work was somewhat of a redemption for 2020. 
It did not make up or offset everything 2020 brought - but it certainly was nice to take a step back in the right direction 
and roll into 2021 on a high.

I fully intend to write more here and give better updates on all of my projects and hobbies - and so I started with a new
look for the site and moving the site to Netlify!  I'm quite impressed.

More to come!
