Life has been busy over the past year!  I was promoted to an engineering manager and it has been a fascinating experience.  Though I am part of the engineering process, I spend more of my time working on roadmaps, assigning tasks, managing issues that arise, and attending meetings.  My experience and knowledge as an engineer have definitely been beneficial to the managing process - but overall I have had to become a much more big picture person than a coder.

I bought a motorcycle and rode it through Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia!  It was an amazing trip and wind therapy is so real.

In 2022 I found a new Church home that has been amazing.  I love the community and everyone involved.  By the end of the year I even began playing in the praise band which has been amazing.  As part of my New Years resolutions, I will be going on a mission trip this year, and I am so looking forward to that.

Other resolutions for 2023 (some started late 2022):

* Read the Bible chronologically in a year.

* Take a step back from so much time online which meant cutting out a lot of online hangouts I was a part of.  This has been amazing for my sanity and personal growth and I can't recommend it enough!

* Spend time working on personal programming projects again.

* Start dating again (Scary!)

* Read more books.

* Gym. Obviously.  What is a resolution list without including the gym?

I'd like to post here more and add more content and information to the site as well as do some Twitch streaming when I'm working on projects.

Blessings!

Stephen
