Lately my main focus has been working with a great team, some of which are old friends, on a new golang cross-platform toolkit called Fyne.  You can read more about it here: [Fyne](http://www.fyne.io)

I have been spending a significant amount of work lately on the Fyne Desktop which you can read about here: [Fynedesk Features and Improvements](/posts/fynedesk/)
