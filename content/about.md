Howdy y'all!  My name is Stephen and I am a software engineer.  I currently work for [Bread Financial](https://breadfinancial.com)
as a Go engineer developing backend microservices. I have a lot of fun hobbies that include building and crafting,
side projects, sports, the outdoors, music, and food.  I also like to ramble and discuss a lot of topics. Explore to
read those ramblings and see details about those hobbies!
