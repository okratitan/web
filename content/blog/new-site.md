You probably notice the new look and design here for this site.  Welcome and thanks for visiting!

This is the easiest way for me to keep up with my own sanity: Projects, resume, rumblings, images, tutorials.  It is also a way for me to share knowledge that will help anyone looking to get started on projects similar to those I work on!

I recently have been working with a new Golang UI toolkit called Fyne.  This was my first dive into Golang and along the way I found out about Hugo - a static site creator that uses Golang.  This peaked my curiosity and the end result is the site you see here!
