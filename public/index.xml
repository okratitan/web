      <description>Over the course of the last month I have been putting a lot of time into improving the Fyne Desktop. Fyne Desktop is an X11 desktop environment written in Go. The project founder Andrew Williams, whom I consider to be a close friend, built a solid base to work from with basic window manager functionality. After I joined on the Fyne project as a contributor, one of my first areas of interest was the desktop.</description>

      <description>You probably notice the new look and design here for this site. Welcome and thanks for visiting!
This is the easiest way for me to keep up with my own sanity: Projects, resume, rumblings, images, tutorials. It is also a way for me to share knowledge that will help anyone looking to get started on projects similar to those I work on!
I recently have been working with a new Golang UI toolkit called Fyne.</description>

      <description>This is a bugfix release that also contains a slight change to the interface of Ephoto. The main interface is no longer using the translucent overlay panels for file browsing and such. It is now using standard elementary widgets and no longer hovers over other items hiding your images. This release also fixes the issues with compiling and running Ephoto with EFL 1.20. This release will bridge the gap between 1.</description>

Ephoto is an image viewer and editor written using the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries. It focuses on simplicity and ease of use, while taking advantage of the speed and small footprint the EFL provide. You can view Ephoto&amp;rsquo;s project page on the Enlightenment wiki located at: https://phab.enlightenment.org/w/projects/ephoto. Ephoto&amp;rsquo;s source can be found in the Enlightenment git repository: http://git.enlightenment.org/apps/ephoto.git] or on Github at http://github.</description>

      <description>FyFoto
My first project to get my feet wet with Fyne has been FyFoto. It will basically have all the functionality and behavior that EPhoto (see below) has - except it will be written in Go and Fyne which I find more attractive than the EFL these days.
You can find Fyfoto at my Github here: FyFoto Git FyFoto has not been released or made publicly available yet, but I plan to have it on Github very soon!</description>
