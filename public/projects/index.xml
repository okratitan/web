      <description>Ephoto
Ephoto 1.5 Has Been Released!!!
Read The Release Post For More Information!
Ephoto is an image viewer and editor written using the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries. It focuses on simplicity and ease of use, while taking advantage of the speed and small footprint the EFL provide. You can view Ephoto&amp;rsquo;s project page on the Enlightenment wiki located at: https://phab.enlightenment.org/w/projects/ephoto. Ephoto&amp;rsquo;s source can be found in the Enlightenment git repository: http://git.enlightenment.org/apps/ephoto.git] or on Github at http://github.</description>

      <description>FyFoto
My first project to get my feet wet with Fyne has been FyFoto. It will basically have all the functionality and behavior that EPhoto (see below) has - except it will be written in Go and Fyne which I find more attractive than the EFL these days.
You can find Fyfoto at my Github here: FyFoto Git FyFoto has not been released or made publicly available yet, but I plan to have it on Github very soon!</description>

      <description>Fyne and Fyne Desktop
Lately my main focus has been working with a great team, some of which are old friends, on a new golang cross-platform toolkit called Fyne. You can read more about it here: Fyne
I have been spending a significant amount of work lately on the Fyne Desktop which you can read about here: Fynedesk Features and Improvements</description>
